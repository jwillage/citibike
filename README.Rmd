The set of files included are an exploratory data analysis of the publicly
provided Citi Bike data available [here.](http://www.citibikenyc.com/system-data)
Citi Bike is a bike sharing system in New York City that lets riders rent 
bikes for commuting purposes.

##TODO##
*  Integrate distance data using [Google Maps Directions API][1]. Make a web
call, i.e.:  
https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/directions/json?origin=98%20suffolk%20st%20nyc&destination=164%20Bedford%20Avenue&mode=bicycling
*  Aggregate each month's file at a time. Not enough memory to load entire data
set then aggregate. Average month has ~650K rows. Even grouping by hour and 
start location would yield 1/3 the rows. Need to reduce at least an order of 
magnitude. Instead of every hour of the month, maybe:  
    * break into hour intervals by station (24 * 330 rows/file).  
    * Or days by station (30 * 330 rows/file).  
    * By start station and end station combinations (< (330^2) since people will 
  not pick up in BK and return in midtown, for example)  
*  Lifetime of bicycle. Track bike by ID and see which bikes accumlate more miles, are they taken out of rotation?  
*  Use average speed to determine bike friendliness of an a neighborhood. Use average speed vs traffic to determine if bike or car is faster as certain points throughout the day.
